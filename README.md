PURPOSE:
    Here, This project was made to blur images by the scale you want, just paste the path of the image to blur, then type the scale or the size of each part of the image that will look like individual pixels, but that in fact are not, and then you're going to have wait some time depending on the size of the image and the scale. Finally, you can paste the destination of your new blured image with its name and the extension JPG.

NOTE:
   This program only makes a copy of the image and blurs it, it does not modify it by any means.
